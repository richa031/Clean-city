# Clean-city
## Problem Statement: Conceptualise and design a software solution to make a city clean and garbage free.

When it comes to a solution for smart city the first thought is making dustbins smart or we can say making them talk. Smart bins, or solar-powered trash compactor are already in use across the globe, from Brooklyn, New York to England and Queensland in Australia. These bins use smart sensors to know when to begin compacting the rubbish and to alert the collectors when they're full â€“ making the serving of the garbage collection much more efficient.

The idea is to make an application where these sensors can be connected to the users mobile so that they can manage their garbage with the help of technology.

This smart dustbin operates automatically to help keep city clean using IOT and sensor based circuitry. Usual dustbins require to be opened by pressing foot against its lever and then throwing garbage. Also a person needs to keep track when it is full so that it can be emptied and does not overflow. Here we propose a smart dustbin that does all this by itself. The system will consist of a sensor in order to detect human clap signal and on a clap of foot tap it opens automatically without anyone needing to press its lever. The dustbin opens automatically when it receives the signal and closes its hatch. Also the dustbin consists of a level sensing ultrasonic sensor that constantly measures the level of garbage in the bin and automatically detects if it is about to fill up.
The dustbin now consists of a smart circuitry that transmits this information over the web to signal the main garbage collector of the facility to empty the particular garbage bin. We use IOTgecko to develop the online web part for the iot system. This bin is of a vast usage in offices, homes and even in public places for garbage management. 

Thus we get a fully automated smart dustbin that allows for automated garbage cleaning. This same application can be utilized by the authorities managing garbage so as to ease the process.
